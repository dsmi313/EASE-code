# Set species of interest (STHD or CHNK)
spp <- "CHNK"
```

#### Query the Lower Granite Trapping database.

This query was intentionally designed to only accept CHNK or STHD as a species; any other entry in the above chunk will cause an error if you try to run this query. This query uses the odbc() and DBI() package to pass a SQL query to our Microsoft SQL Server instance at Nampa Research.
```{r}
# Connect to LGDTrapping DB
Connection <- 
  dbConnect(odbc(),
            Driver = "ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server",
            Server = "idfgnrsql2",
            Database = "LGDTrapping",
            Trusted_Connection = "yes")

# Send Query to server. All variables in LGDTrapping DB are queried
qryLGTrappingRecords <- dbSendQuery(Connection,
  "SELECT *
  FROM TempLGTrappingExcelPivotfromvwLGDMasterCombine
  WHERE CollectionLocation = 'Lower Granite Dam ->'
  AND SpawnYear = ?
  AND LGDValid = 1 
  AND LGDSpecies = ?
  AND LGDLifeStage = 'RF'",
  params = list(paste0("SY", as.character(sy)), 
                as.character(case_when(spp == "STHD" ~ 3,
                                       spp == "CHNK" ~ 1))))
##Setting LGDValid=1 for CHNk only includes spring-summer run period

# Retrieve results from query
LGTrappingRecords <- dbFetch(qryLGTrappingRecords)

# Clear results on server
dbClearResult(qryLGTrappingRecords)

# Disconnect from server
dbDisconnect(Connection)
```

Check the data for valid entries. The SQL query specifies LGDValid = 1, so there should not be any missing data in FLmm, CollectionDate, LGDSpecies or AD-Clip status (or LGDRear, but we won't check that because we use GenRear in EASE). Nonetheless, let's check those fields.
```{r message=TRUE, warning=TRUE, paged.print=TRUE}
# Make sure no NAs in FLmm
LGTrappingRecords %>% 
  filter(is.na(LGDFLmm)) %>% 
  count() #0 rows with NA in LGDFLmm or use summary(LGTrappingRecords$LGDFLmm)

# Check the range of fork lengths to be sure no record with FLmm < 300 is included and all fork lengths are realistic.
LGTrappingRecords %>% 
  summarise(min(LGDFLmm), max(LGDFLmm)) 

# Make sure no NAs in CollectionDate
LGTrappingRecords %>% 
  filter(is.na(CollectionDate)) %>% 
  count() # 0 NAs

# Check range of the collection date (chnk = Mar 1 to Aug 17; sthd = 7/1 of prev. calendar year to 6/30 of spawn year)
LGTrappingRecords %>% 
  summarise(min(CollectionDate), max(CollectionDate))

# Check SRR: chnk SRR should all start with 1. Check no NAs. 
# For run, GenRun used if available, otherwise LGDRun used.
# 3 = Fall run CHNK for GenRun and LGDRun. 
# LGDRun=5 is unknown run (but assume/likely that it's spring-summer run given run period) 
# GenRun=5 is spring/summer run CHNK. 
# Some fall run CHNK are trapped at LGR during the spring-summer run period.
LGTrappingRecords %>% 
  group_by(SRR) %>% 
  summarise(n = n(), .groups = "drop") %>% 
  bind_rows(
    summarise(., across(where(is.numeric), sum), SRR = "Total")
  )

# Check LGDMarkAD to ensure that only AI and AD are present (no NAs)
LGTrappingRecords %>% 
  count(LGDMarkAD) %>% 
  bind_rows(
    summarise(., across(where(is.numeric), sum), LGDMarkAD = "Total")
  )

LGTrappingRecords %>%

```

### Formatting LGTrappingRecords for EASE input

To format the raw data for EASE we need several new variables as well as changes to existing variables. I will preserve the original columns for the QC steps below. New columns will be appended (2 at end of column names) to make them easy to identify and select for the new dataframe. Above each code chunk I will list the name of the new column and explain how it was computed

- LGDSpecies2: exact copy of LGDSpecies, but we want to keep that field, so I'm adding the 2 to make it easier to pick out at the end.
- CollectionDate2: reformatted CollectionDate using the ymd() function to make it easier to work with using the lubridate package.
- PBTBYHat2: calculated from GenPBT_ByHat. Blank strings and "NG" are converted to NA_character_, "Unassigned-H" and "Unassigned-W" are converted to "Unassigned", all other values are preserved.
- physTag2: Calculated from LGDTagsAll. TRUE if there is a CWT, left ventral fin clip or right ventral fin clip. Check no NAs

RUN chunk to verify PBTBYHat2 and physTag2. 
```{r rows.print = 200}

                              TRUE ~ GenPBT_ByHat),
         physTag2 = grepl("[Ww]ire", LGDTagsAll) | grepl("[LR]V", LGDMarksAll))

# Check PBTBYHat2
FormattedLGTrappingRecords %>% 
  group_by(GenPBT_ByHat, PBTBYHat2) %>% 
  summarise(n = n(), .groups = "drop") %>% 
  bind_rows(
    summarise(., across(where(is.numeric), sum),

              across(where(is.character), ~"Total"))
  )#good; wire is CWT; LV & RV are left ventral fin clip and right ventral fin clip
```

- PBTRGroup2: Calculated from GenPBT_RGroup. Blank strings and "NG" are converted to NA_character_, "Unassigned-H" and "Unassigned-W" are converted to "Unassigned", all other values are preserved.
Run chunk to verify:
```{r rows.print = 200}
FormattedLGTrappingRecords <- FormattedLGTrappingRecords %>%
  mutate(PBTRGroup2 = case_when(GenPBT_RGroup %in% c("NG", "","#N/A") ~ NA_character_,
                                grepl("Unassigned", GenPBT_RGroup) ~ "Unassigned",
                                TRUE ~ GenPBT_RGroup))

# Verify PBTRGroup2
FormattedLGTrappingRecords %>% 
  group_by(GenPBT_RGroup, PBTRGroup2) %>% 
  summarise(n = n(), .groups = "drop") %>% 
  bind_rows(
    summarise(., across(where(is.numeric), sum), 
              across(where(is.character), ~"Total"))
  ) #good
```

- Rear2: Calculated from SRR and LGDMarkAD. The code to generate Rear2 is based on the SRR field from the LGDTrapping database. SRR uses a standard hierarchical formula to assign a rear based on AD clip status, physical tags, PBT and GSI results. 

Use the first output to check that records with SRR XXH and LGDMarkAD "AD" are set to "H". Records with SRR XXH and LGDMarkAD "AI" are set to "HNC". Records with SRR XXW and LGDMarkAD "AI" are set to "W". 

The second output is for confirming that the underlying factors that determine SRR are all correct and valid. For the purpose of summarizing and error checking, we categorize assignments into Assigned for any records that assigned to any hatchery or release group. This helps viewability by compressing the second output so that we don't have to view every RGroup. The transformation only applies to the view, not the main dataset. Check: All AI fish with a physical tag or assigned to PBT are HNC. All other AI fish are W. FYI: physTag2=TRUE if there is a CWT, left ventral fin clip or right ventral fin clip. Keep in mind that Wild fish that assigned to a genstock will be unassigned for PBT. Wild fish with NA for genstock will be NA for PBT.

```{r rows.print = 200}
FormattedLGTrappingRecords <- FormattedLGTrappingRecords %>% 
  mutate(Rear2 = case_when(str_sub(SRR, 3,3) == "H" & LGDMarkAD == "AD" ~ "H",
                          str_sub(SRR, 3,3) == "H" & LGDMarkAD == "AI" ~ "HNC",
                          str_sub(SRR, 3,3) == "W" & LGDMarkAD == "AI" ~ "W",
                          TRUE ~ ""))

# Check 1: Verify SRR, LGDMarkAD, and Rear2 combinations
FormattedLGTrappingRecords %>% 
  group_by(SRR, LGDMarkAD, Rear2) %>% 
  summarise(n = n(), .groups = "drop") %>% 
  bind_rows(
    summarise(., across(where(is.numeric), sum), 
              across(where(is.character), ~"Total"))
  )

# Check 2: Verify underlying factors (physTag, PBT assignments)
FormattedLGTrappingRecords %>% 
  mutate(PBTRGroup2 = if_else(grepl("^2", PBTRGroup2), "Assigned", PBTRGroup2),
         PBTBYHat2 = if_else(grepl("^2", PBTBYHat2), "Assigned", PBTBYHat2)) %>% 
  group_by(LGDMarkAD, physTag2, PBTRGroup2, PBTBYHat2, Rear2) %>% 
  summarise(n = n(), .groups = "drop") %>% 
  arrange(LGDMarkAD, desc(physTag2)) 

# Find these 6 problem fish
FormattedLGTrappingRecords %>%
  filter(LGDMarkAD == "AI", 
         physTag2 == FALSE,
         is.na(PBTRGroup2),
         is.na(PBTBYHat2),
         Rear2 == "HNC") %>%
  select(MasterID, SRR, LGDMarkAD, physTag2, PBTRGroup2, PBTBYHat2, 
         GenStock, GenStockProb2, Rear2)
```

Rear2: QAQC checks between the original data (LGTrappingRecords) and formatted data (FormattedLGTrappingRecords) by running the following table in console, table(LGTrappingRecords$LGDMarkAD), and comparing to output 1 above. 
step 1: Total AD fish is = between datasets
step 2: Total AI fish in original = sum of HNC and W fish in formatted
step 3: Total fish is = between datasets

-GenSex2: Calculated from GenSex. Preserves all "M" and "F" designations while setting "U" and "NG" to NA_character_. 

RUN chunk to verify
```{r rows.print = 200}
FormattedLGTrappingRecords <- FormattedLGTrappingRecords %>% 
  mutate(GenSex2 = case_when(GenSex %in% c("M", "F") ~ GenSex,
                             TRUE ~ NA_character_))

# Verify GenSex2
FormattedLGTrappingRecords %>% 
  group_by(GenSex, GenSex2) %>% 
  summarise(n = n(), .groups = "drop") %>% 
  bind_rows(
    summarise(., across(where(is.numeric), sum), 
              across(where(is.character), ~"Total"))
  )#good
```

GenSex2: QAQC checks by running following in console and comparing to output above: 
table(LGTrappingRecords$GenSex)

LGTrappingRecords %>%
group_by(GenSex)%>%
summarise(n=n()) #shows number of NAs in original data

step 1-2: 1) Number of males and 2) number of females is = between the datasets
step 3: Number of NAs in GenSex2 col in formatted = the sum of NG, U, and NAs in original.
step 4: Total fish is = between datasets

- GenStock2: Calculated from GenStock and Rear2. Sets all records where GenStock is "NG" or "NA" to NA_character_. Sets all records where Rear2 is "H" or "HNC" to NA_character_. All GenStocks are preserved.

RUN chunk to verify. The first output is to check that all "H" and "HNC" records are set to NA for GenStock2 assignment. The second is filtered to only include wild fish. Use it to confirm that "NG" was converted to NA_character_ and that only the expected GenStocks are present.
```{r rows.print = 200}
FormattedLGTrappingRecords <- FormattedLGTrappingRecords %>% 
  mutate(GenStock2 = case_when(GenStock %in% c("NG", "NA", "", "#N/A") ~ NA_character_,
                               Rear2 %in% c("H", "HNC") ~ NA_character_,
                               grepl("LO[W?]CLWR", GenStock) ~ "LOCLWR",
                               grepl("LO[W?]SALM", GenStock) ~ "LOSALM",
                               TRUE ~ GenStock))

# Check 1: Verify H and HNC set to NA
FormattedLGTrappingRecords %>% 
  group_by(Rear2, GenStock2) %>% 
  summarise(n = n(), .groups = "drop") %>% 
  bind_rows(
    summarise(., across(where(is.numeric), sum), 
              across(where(is.character), ~"Total"))
  )

# Check 2: Verify Wild fish GenStock assignments
FormattedLGTrappingRecords %>% 
  filter(Rear2 == "W") %>% 
  group_by(GenStock, GenStock2) %>% 
  summarise(n = n(), .groups = "drop")
```

- MPG2: Calculated from GenStock2 and LGDSpecies. 
If LGDSpecies = 1 (CHNK), then CHMBLN GenStock becomes MFSALM MPG. All other GenStocks are preserved as the GenStock and MPG names are the same. Note- HELLSC (Hells Canyon stock) is an aggregate genetic stock that includes the Clearwater, Little Salmon, lower Salmon, Grande Ronde, Imnaha, and lower Snake rivers. All fish with an assigned GenStock and MPG should be W rear and AI. 

RUN chunk to verify
```{r rows.print = 200}
FormattedLGTrappingRecords <- FormattedLGTrappingRecords %>% 
  mutate(MPG2 = if_else(LGDSpecies == "1", # CHNK specific MPGs
                        case_when(GenStock2 == "CHMBLN" ~ "MFSALM",
                                  TRUE ~ GenStock2),
                        case_when(GenStock2 == NA_character_ ~ NA_character_,
                                  TRUE ~ GenStock2)))

# Verify MPG2
FormattedLGTrappingRecords %>% 
  group_by(Rear2, GenStock2, MPG2, LGDMarkAD) %>% 
  summarise(n = n(), .groups = "drop") %>% 
  bind_rows(
    summarise(., across(where(is.numeric), sum), 
              across(where(is.character), ~"Total"))
  ) #good
```


- BioScaleFinalAge2: Calculated from BioScaleFinalAge and Rear2. Removes ages from H and HNC fish, removes whitespace from ages.
- fwAge2: Calculated from BioScaleFinalAge2. Sets any record with BioScaleFinalAge of "N:A" or with a "?" to NA_character_ then takes the first character of the age and applies it to the fwAge2 variable.
- swAge2: Calculated from BioScaleFinalAge2. Sets any record with BioScaleFinalAge of "N:A" or with a "?" to NA_character_, looks at the saltwater portion of the age and changes MJ to 0 for age 0 salt, if neither of the above are true, takes everything after the semicolon and applies it to swAge2. After Age2 and totalAge2 are calculated, set anything with an "S" or "R" to "Repeat".
- Age2: If fwAge2 is NA, sets Age2 to NA_character_. If not, concatenates "F", fwAge2, "S", and swAge2.
- TotalAge2: Calculated from swAge2 and fwAge2. From swAge2, it replaces any S or R with a 1, splits each character apart and then adds them together for a total swAge (this is the step that converts repeat spawner age notation into an age in years). Sums fwAge2, swAge2 and adds 1 for the winter in gravel. The equation boils down to: [fwAge + swAge + 1] = totalAge2
- BY2: Calculated from SpawnYear and totalAge2. If TotalAge2 is NA, then set to NA_character_. Otherwise extract the four digit year from SpawnYear, subtract totalAge2 and append BY to beginning. Equation is [SpawnYear - totalAge2] = BY2

QAQC checks for age data by running following in console:
age.df<-LGTrappingRecords %>% 
filter(SRR =='13W'|SRR=='15W') %>% 
group_by(SRR, BioScaleFinalAge) %>% 
summarise(n=n()) Try copy+paste to excel for summing

sum(age.df$n) #total number of fish. Subtract number of wild fish w/o fwAge AND swAge from this total to yield number of wild fish with fwAge AND swAge in original data.

Step 1: Number of NAs for wild fish with total ages in formatted (output 2 above) = number of wild fish that don't have a fwAge AND swAge in original
Step 2: Number of wild fish with total age in formatted = number of wild fish with a fwAge AND swAge in original
Step 3: Total fish is = between datasets
#can write code to sum NA's in formatted data

- ReleaseGroup2: Calculated from Rear2, PBTBYHat2 and PBTRGroup2. The goal here is to remove PBTRGroup from both wild fish and fish without a PBTBYHat designation (we don't want fish that could not be genotyped to hatchery), call "Unassigned" fish "Unassigned" , and finally preserve the RGroup if none of the above is true. In other words, We set release group of hatchery fish to NA when PBTBYHat is NA and set their release group to unassigned when PBTBYHat is unassigned.

Check for first output: When Rear == "W" and assigned to GenStock (!NA for GenStock), ReleaseGroup2 set to Unassigned and wild fish with NA for genstock are set to NA for ReleaseGroup2). When PBTBYHat2 is NA sets ReleaseGroup2 to NA. When PBTBYHat2 is "Unassigned", sets ReleaseGroup2 to "Unassigned".

QAQC checks for ReleaseGroup2 by running following in console:
Object.View.all.cols.at.once<-FormattedLGTrappingRecords %>% 
  group_by(Rear2, PBTBYHat2, PBTRGroup2, ReleaseGroup2) %>% 
  summarise(n = n()) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  bind_rows(summarise_all(., ~if(is.numeric(.)) sum(., na.rm = TRUE) else "Total"))
  
Original.data.releasegrp.counts<-LGTrappingRecords %>% filter(SRR %in% c('13H','15H'), LGDMarkAD=='AI')%>% group_by(SRR,LGDMarkAD,GenPBT_RGroup)%>%summarise(n=n())
sum(Original.data.releasegrp.counts$n) #subtract counts of fish that did not assign to a GenPBT_RGroup (i.e., #N/A, Unassigned-H, NG, and NA) to get count that did assign. Do this in formatted (output above) and original datasets


# ReleaseGroup2 QAQC checks:
# Step 1: HNC with assigned ReleaseGroup2
FormattedLGTrappingRecords %>%
  filter(Rear2 == "HNC", !is.na(ReleaseGroup2), ReleaseGroup2 != "Unassigned") %>%
  nrow()  # Should equal 897

# Step 2: HNC with NA ReleaseGroup2  
FormattedLGTrappingRecords %>%
  filter(Rear2 == "HNC", is.na(ReleaseGroup2)) %>%
  nrow()  # Should equal 26 (13 #N/A + 7 NG + 6 NA from Output 2)

# Step 3: Total HNC
FormattedLGTrappingRecords %>%
  filter(Rear2 == "HNC") %>%
  nrow()  # Should equal 949

Step 1: The number of HNC fish assigned to a ReleaseGroup2 in formatted (output 2 above) = the number of AI Hatchery fish assigned to a GenPBT_RGroup in original
Step 2: Number of HNC fish with NA for ReleaseGroup2 in formatted (output 2 above) = sum of Hatchery AI fish that are NG and NA for GenPBT_RGroup in original
Step 3: Total fish is = between datasets
  
- sWeek2: Calculated from WeekNumber and the year of CollectionDate. Concatenation of CollectionDate year and WeekNumber separated by an underscore.
- lenCat2: Calculated from spp and LGDFLmm. For "CHNK", anything over 570mm is "Lg", the rest "Sm".

This chunk outputs three dataframes. Use first to check that sWeek2 column was created correctly. Can use it to see how many fish were trapped in each statistical week. 

Use second to check that statistical week starts on a Monday and ends on Sunday, as well as the length of the statistical week. In some cases, the trap was only open during the weekdays (closed on weekends during spring-summer CHNK run period 3/1-8/17; stat week from Mon-Fri) or was closed on days other than the weekends. The start and end of the run period (dates) will often not be a Mon/Sun. In these cases the week could appear shorter than you might expect. We may not trap fish on the 1st and last dates of the run period and these dates may not fall on a Mon or Fri/Sun. These dates are when the fish were trapped so may not have trapped fish at the start or end of a statistical wk. Can use emailed LGR weekly trap summary to check these cases. FYI: LGTrap week numbers are not all sweeks of the SY but are the sweeks when fish were trapped. But window count and strata files include all sweeks of the SY

Use third to view totals in each length category. Check that no NAs and that total fish is = between original and formatted data.

```{r rows.print = 200}
FormattedLGTrappingRecords <- FormattedLGTrappingRecords %>% 
  mutate(sWeek2 = paste0(year(CollectionDate), "_", WeekNumber))

FormattedLGTrappingRecords <- FormattedLGTrappingRecords %>% 
  mutate(lenCat2 = case_when(spp == "STHD" ~ if_else(LGDFLmm >= 780, "Lg", "Sm"),
                            spp == "CHNK" ~ if_else(LGDFLmm >= 570, "Lg", "Sm")))

# Output 1: Check sWeek2 creation and fish counts per week

  group_by(year(CollectionDate), WeekNumber, sWeek2) %>% 
  summarise(n = n(), .groups = "drop") %>% 
  bind_rows(
    summarise(., across(where(is.numeric), sum), 
              across(where(is.character), ~"Total"))
  ) %>% 
  print(n = 100)

# Output 2: Check statistical week dates (Mon-Fri/Sun)
FormattedLGTrappingRecords %>% 
  group_by(sWeek2) %>% 
  summarise(minDate = min(CollectionDate2), 
            minDayofWeek = wday(min(CollectionDate2), label = TRUE), 
            maxDate = max(CollectionDate2), 
            maxDayofWeek = wday(max(CollectionDate2), label = TRUE),
            sWeekLength = max(CollectionDate2) - min(CollectionDate2) + 1,
            .groups = "drop")

# Output 3: Check length categories
FormattedLGTrappingRecords %>% 
  group_by(lenCat2) %>% 
  summarise(n = n(), .groups = "drop") %>% 
  bind_rows(
    summarise(., across(where(is.numeric), sum), 
              across(where(is.character), ~"Total"))
